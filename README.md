# CAPM – Study Guide & Exam Tips

I recently cleared the CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) exam and wanted to share my preparation journey. The CAPM is designed for beginners or those starting their project management career. Unlike the PMP, the exam is more knowledge-oriented, but the new CAPM exam (2023 update) also includes scenario-based questions and a strong Agile component.

Expect a mix of direct knowledge questions (definitions, concepts) and situational questions where you need to pick the best approach. About half of the exam is Agile/Hybrid focused, with the rest on Predictive (Waterfall) and general project management principles.

## Preparation Timeline (3–4 weeks)

1. **Week 1**: Read PMBOK Guide (7th Edition) and skim the Agile Practice Guide.  
2. **Week 2**: Watched video courses (Andrew Ramdayal CAPM course, PMP content that overlaps).  
3. **Week 3–4**: Practice exams (Skillcertpro. About 70–80% of the real exam was very similar in style and difficulty to these. Lot of questions came word to word from these. So these are the must for CAPM exam. Spend atleast one full week doing these tests)

2. **Agile and Hybrid**  
   - Scrum, Kanban basics  
   - Agile principles and values (Agile Manifesto)  
   - Iterative vs incremental development  
   - Agile planning: backlog, sprints, velocity  

3. **Predictive (Waterfall) Methods**

## Exam-Day Strategy

- 150 questions in 180 minutes.  
- No scheduled breaks, but you can take unscheduled breaks (time keeps running).  
- Expect both knowledge-based and scenario-based questions.  
- Read carefully: look for words like *best*, *first*, *next*.  
- Eliminate clearly wrong answers to narrow choices.

## Resources That Helped

- Skillcertpro CAPM Practice Exams (Paid)
- PMBOK Guide (7th Edition) + Agile Practice Guide  
- Andrew Ramdayal’s CAPM Prep course and PMP overlap content  
- Flashcards for Agile terms and business analysis keywords  
- PMI sample CAPM exam questions

## Exam-Day Experience

The exam felt less intense than PMP but still tricky. About 50% of my exam was Agile/Hybrid questions, especially on Scrum roles, Agile values, and ceremonies. The rest was split between predictive project basics and business analysis scenarios. Many questions were short, but some were situational requiring judgment. Time was sufficient — I finished with about 20 minutes left.

## Final Tip

The CAPM exam tests foundational project management knowledge along with Agile and business analysis concepts. Focus on understanding principles, not memorizing. If you can score 75–80% consistently on practice exams and review Agile + predictive basics, you will be well-prepared to pass.
